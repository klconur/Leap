# Leap

Two 3rd party libraries have been used for the project.

1. [UIView-Shimmer](https://github.com/omerfarukozturk/UIView-Shimmer)

This library applies the shimmering effect to the views in an easy way.

2. [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageSwiftUI)

It is a very popular library and this library provides an async image downloader with cache support.

### Dependency Manager

[Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)

### Architecture Pattern

I chose the MVVM (Model View ViewModel) Architecture Pattern because this design pattern helps in the maintenance of the software and provides more clean and structured code.

### Views

I developed views (and view cells) programmatically which provides more flexibility to me. There is one storyboard on the project, this contains TabBarController and ViewControllers.

### API

I created a dummy JSON file as a backend service. You can check it on [this link](https://okb.com.tr/data.json)

### Card Tap

Card tap is triggering only an alert with the title.
