# Leap

Two 3rd party libraries have been used for the project.

1. [UIView-Shimmer](https://github.com/omerfarukozturk/UIView-Shimmer)

This library applies the shimmering effect to the views in an easy way.

2. [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageSwiftUI)

It is a very popular library and this library provides an async image downloader with cache support.

### Dependency Manager

[Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)

### Architecture Pattern

I chose the MVVM (Model View ViewModel) Architecture Pattern because this design pattern helps in the maintenance of the software and provides more clean and structured code.

### Views
