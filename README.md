### Libraries

Two 3rd party libraries have been used for the project.

1. [UIView-Shimmer](https://github.com/omerfarukozturk/UIView-Shimmer)

This library applies the shimmering effect to the views in an easy way.

2. [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageSwiftUI)

It is a very popular library and this library provides an async image downloader with cache support.

### Dependency Manager

[Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)

### Architecture Pattern

I chose the MVVM (Model View ViewModel) Architecture Pattern because this design pattern helps in the maintenance of the software and provides more clean and structured code.

### Function and Variable Naming conventions

Camelcase: Words are delimited by capital letters, except the initial word.

### Views

I developed views (and view cells) programmatically which provides more flexibility to me. There is one storyboard on the project, this contains TabBarController and ViewControllers.

### API

I created a dummy JSON file as a backend service. You can check it on [this link](https://okb.com.tr/data.json)

### Card Tap

Card tap is triggering only an alert with the title.

### Errors

I don't categorize the errors yet, I am just showing the "no internet error" view when I am getting an error. I used SwiftUI for this screen.

### Other Tabs

Other tabs have not been implemented yet. Activity, Calendar, Account.

### Improvements

1. [bindTableViewData](https://github.com/klconur/Leap/blob/main/Leap/Controllers/HomeViewController.swift#L52) function is not flexible enough. I need to implement it in a different way.

2. Normally, I don't like to use hardcoded texts in a project but there are some hardcoded texts in this project.

3. (Sunday January 16 update) For ViewCell actions, I have added tapgesture recognizer to each view. This is not memory friendly, I would like to change it with didRowAt function.
